Some advice I pass along to other software engineers sometimes.

## General advice
* Meet people! See what you can learn from what they're doing, and maybe you can share what you're learning too. Also, learn about where they're working. You can ask them if they know of any job openings.
* Learning programming/software engineering skills
    * [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - lots of good in-depth tutorials in many different areas (full stack, AI/ML, data science, even data structures/algorithms)
    * [DataTalksClub](https://datatalks.club/) - DataTalksClub has free online courses and cohorts for learning data engineering, ML, MLOps. Includes homework as well as projects and a slack community
    * Side projects - pick something you want to build (doesn't have to be totally novel or earth shattering), build it, and **find ways to go deep** (this is the most important part)
       * [Austin Henley's project ideas](https://austinhenley.com/blog/challengingprojects.html)
       * Publish your side projects in Github. Even if the company you're interviewing at doesn't look at your Github, it's good to have a record of what you learned
    * Write learnings in a personal blog - a good way to track what you're learning and also publicly show it
      * This also helps you solidify what you're learning. If you can explain it, it means you've learned that topic well
      * [Dev.to](https://dev.to) is one example of an online community where people write blogs about their learnings

## Interviewing
* Polish up resume
* Always ask clarifying questions (no assumptions, make it clear to yourself and interviewer what you're trying)
* Mock interviews
    * Ask friends, school colleagues, etc. if they can help you do mock interviews
    * [Interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io) also provides some anonymous interviews, might cost money
* Interviewing skills
   * [Blind 75](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions) - Leetcode questions that are categorized. Very helpful in learning the types of questions interviewers ask
   * [Interviewing.io system design guide](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview) - system design interview guide (free!). Usually for senior engineers, but also helpful any level of engineer
   * [Youtube mock interviews](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mock+interview+software+engineer) - Lots of recorded mock interiews on youtube
   * Interview preparation newsletters - 2 that I recommend for system design and FAANG interview questions
       * [ByteByteGo](https://blog.bytebytego.com/)
       * [Quastor](https://www.quastor.org/)

## Books

A lot of the information in books can be found for free on the internet, but books provide a nice packaging of the ideas. A good book's ideas will flow logically, and the structure makes it easy to consume and process these ideas.

### "Power skills" books

Call it soft skills if you want, but these are the skills that actually help you go places as you climb the ladder.

### Technical books
